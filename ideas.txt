Potential modification to make:

* Write csv files with each pull, instead of only at the end of execution.
* Adjust the main loop such that it only
  does data pull if the cell == 0.
* With the two above points, one should be able
  to resume a run of data pulls in the case of some
  sort of runtime error that interrupts execution.
